JavaScript Function is a block of code that is designed to perform a task and executed when it is been called or invoked.

Below are the ways of writing functions in JavaScript:

Function Declaration
Function Declaration is the traditional way to define a function. It is somehow similar to the way we define a function in other programming languages. We start declaring using the keyword “function”. Then we write the function name and the parameters.

Example: Below is an example that illustrates the use of Function Declaration.

-------------------------------

// Function declaration 
function add(a, b) {         
    console.log(a + b);
}
 
// Calling a function
add(2, 3);

Console Log:
5

Output
5
After defining a function, we call it whenever the function is required.

---------------------------------------------

Function Expression
Function Expression is another way to define a function in JavaScript. Here we define a function using a variable and store the returned value in that variable.

----------------------------

Example: Below is an example that illustrates the use of Function Expression.

// Function Expression
const add = function (a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}
 
// Calling function
add(2, 3);

Output

5
----------------------------


Here, the whole function is an expression and the returned value is stored in the variable. We use the variable name to call the function.

Arrow Functions
Arrow functions are been introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. It is used to shorten the code. Here we do not use the “function” keyword and use the arrow symbol.

Example: Below is the example that illustrates the use of the Arrow Function.



// Single line of code
let add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(3, 2));

Output
5
This shortens the code to a single line compared to other approaches. In a single line of code, the function returns implicitly.

Note: When there is a need to include multiple lines of code we use brackets. Also, when there are multiple lines of code in the bracket we should write return explicitly to return the value from the function.

Example: This is an example with multiple lines of code in arrow function

// Multiple line of code
const great = (a, b) => {
    if (a > b)
        return "a is greater";
    else
        return "b is greater";
}
console.log(great(3, 5));

Output
b is greater
