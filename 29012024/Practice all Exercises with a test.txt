Practice Set 1
Now that we've covered the basics of JavaScript, it's time to put our knowledge to the test. In this practice set, we'll cover a range of topics from variables to objects.

Q1: Adding numbers to strings
Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it.

Q2: Using typeof
Use the typeof keyword to see the data type of the variables in the previous question.

Q3: Const objects
Create a constant object in JavaScript and then try to change its value to another data type.

Q4: Modifying const objects
Try to add a new key to the previous const object.

Q5: Month dictionary
Create a JavaScript program to make a month dictionary like 1 = January, 2 = February, and so on.

Q6:Declaring variables
In this exercise, you will practice declaring variables. Tasks

Declare a new variable named petDog and give it the name Rex.
Declare a new variable named petCat and give it the name Pepper.
Console.log the petDog variable.
Console.log the petCat variable.
Console.log the text "My pet dog's name is: " and the petDog variable.
Console.log the text "My pet cat's name is: " and the petCat variable.
Declare another variable and name it catSound. Assign the string of "purr" to it.
Declare another variable and name it dogSound. Assign the string of "woof" to it.
Console.log the variable petDog, then the string "says", then the variable dogSound.
Console.log the variable petCat, then the string "says", then the variable catSound.
Reassign the value stored in catSound to the string "meow".
Console.log the variable petCat, then the string "now says", then the variable catSound. M ake sure to output all your variables. Feel free to play.
Congratulations, you've completed Practice Set 1! If you got everything correct, great job! If not, don't worry - practice makes perfect. Keep practicing and you'll get there.
