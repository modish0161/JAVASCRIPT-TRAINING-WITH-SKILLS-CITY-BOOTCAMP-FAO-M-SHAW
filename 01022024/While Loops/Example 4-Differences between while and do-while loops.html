  // Example 4: Differences between while and do-while loops
  // This script provides a summary of the differences between while and do-while loops.
  // Please view the browser console for the output.

  // Differences between while and do-while loop
  // while loop: while (condition) { statement }
  // do-while loop: do { statement } while (condition);

  // Execution order: while loop checks condition first, then executes the statement if the condition is true.
  // do-while loop executes the statement first, then checks the condition.

  // Number of loops: while loop may execute zero or more times.
  // do-while loop always executes at least once.

  // Use case: while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown or based on a condition.
  // do-while loop is useful when you want to execute a statement at least once, and then check the condition.
